# School-projects

Projects we've been given as assignments throughout my college degree. Some of them have optional functionalities, therefore some potentially vital functionalities might be missing, while some cosmetic functionalities might be present. 
These were all made for study purposes and should be treated as such.
All of them are written in Java. I will not go back and describe every project with a README since most of them do not accurately represent my interests and/or skills.

## Year 1 Projects

These are the assignments we have been given throughout the 1st year of college.

#### Bank (1st term)

This is an assignment meant to demonstrate race conditions and various solutions to the problem.
It is exemplified a superficial banking context.

#### Messaging (1st term)

This assignment was meant to serve as an introduction to the client-server architecture.
The context is a rudimental messaging system. This was heavily customised above the mandatory functionality requirements. 
Details in the README.

#### Graphs (2nd term)

An abstract implementation of graphs and various search algorithms.
Details are missing, since the assignment was automatically marked.
